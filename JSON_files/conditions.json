Second degree heart block is split into 'Mobitz Type I', 'Mobitz Type II' and '2:1/3:1' block. In Mobitz type I block there is progressive prolongation of the PR interval until eventually a wave of conduction fails to propogate to the ventricles. The PR interval returns to normal and the cycle begins again. In Mobitz type II the dropped QRS is not preceded by a prolongation in the PR interval. This can be a random drop or regular. If it is regular is can be expressed as a ratio, e.g. 2:1/3:1 block. The condition is diagnosed on ECG, once found it is important to check for reversible causes of heart block, e.g. ischaemia, hyper/hypokalaemia, hyper/hypocalcaemia.",
