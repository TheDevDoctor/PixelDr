At first it may be difficult to ascertain exactly what is occuring when Mr Wright presents. But from the history and the examination it should be relatively straightforward to diagnose acute urinary retention. The fact that is is painful indicates that this is acute retention and not chronic. Also the tense lower abdomen indicates an expanded bladder.Once you have this diagnosis it is important that the patient is quickly catheterised to relieve the pressure within the bladder. It is important to document how much fluid is drained from the catheter within your notes.Even though the pain will likely dissipate it is unlikely for the patient to be without pain at this stage so paracetamol should be prescribed regularly. It is important at this point that the surgeons come and assess the patient incase any other interventions are required. Usually a trial without catheter will be tried in 3 days time. Therefore, providing there are no contraindications, an alpha blocker should be started soon after catheterisation.","History":{"Correct":{},"Incorrect":{},"Missed":{"Can you tell me more about that?":"Can you tell me more about that?","Do you ever have any dribbling after you go for a wee?":"Do you have dribbling after you wee?","Do you have any family history of any medical conditions?":"Do you have any family history?","Do you have any past medical conditions?":"Do you have any medical conditions?","Do you smoke?":"do you smoke?","Do you take any medications?":"Are you taking any medication?","Does the pain radiate anywhere?":"Does the pain move anywhere?","Have you been passing urine?":"Have you been passing urine?","Have you had any problems with your stomach before?":"Any concerns?","How much do you smoke?":"how much do you smoke?","Is it difficult for you to pass urine?":"Is it difficult to pass urine?","Is it painful when you wee?":"Is it painful when you go for a wee?","What colour is the sputum?":"What colour is the sputum?","What is the pain like?":"what dies the pain feel like?","When did the pain start?":"when did the pain start?","When did you last go for a wee?":"when did you last go for a wee?","Where is the pain?":"where is the pain?","Why are you not feeling very well?":"what is the problem?"}},"Investigations":{"Correct":[],"Incorrect":[],"Missed":["Full Blood Count (FBC)","Urea and Electrolytes","Bladder ultrasound"]},"Management":{"Contact":{"Correct":[],"Incorrect":[],"Missed":["Surgical Reg"]},"Prescriptions":{"Correct":{},"Incorrect":{"OnceOnly":{"Paracetamol":{"Doses":"1000","Routes":"PO","Units":"mg"}}},"Missed":{"AsRequired":[],"Infusion":[],"OnceOnly":[],"Regular":[{"Alfusozin":{"Doses":["10","10"],"DurUnits":"Days","Duration":["3","10"],"Frequency":"OD","Routes":"PO","Tag":0,"Units":"mg"},"Tamulosin":{"Doses":["0.4","0.4"],"DurUnits":"Days","Duration":["3","10"],"Frequency":"OD","Routes":"PO","Tag":1,"Units":"mg"}},{"Paracetamol":{"Doses":["500","1000"],"DurUnits":"Days","Duration":["3","10"],"Frequency":"QDS","Routes":"PO","Tag":1,"Units":"mg"}}]}},"Procedures":{"Correct":[],"Incorrect":[],"Missed":{"Catheter":"The catheter was inserted with some difficulty and 1250ml of fluid was drained."}}},"Notes":"","Scores":{"History":0,"Investigations":0,"Management":{"Contact":0,"Overall":0,"Prescribing":0,"Procedures":0,"endAction":null},"Overall":0},"Sprite":5}},"Scores":{"Overall":0,"Skill":{"History":0,"Investigation":0,"Management":{"Contact":0,"Overall":0,"Prescribing":0,"Procedures":0,"endAction":0}},"Subject":{"Cardiology":0,"Dermatology":0,"Ear, Nose and Throat":0,"Endocrinology":0,"Gastroenterology":0,"Geriatrics":0,"Gynaecology":0,"Haematology":0,"Infectious Diseases":0,"Nephrology":0,"Neurology":0,"Obstetrics":0,"Oncology":0,"Opthalmology":0,"Orthopaedics":0,"Paediatrics":0,"Plastic Surgery":0,"Psychiatry":0,"Respiratory":0,"Rheumatology":0,"Sexual Health":0,"Surgery":0,"Urology":0}},"_attachments":"attachments/","_etag":"\"0000d10f-0000-0000-0000-5ad4a77d0000\"","_rid":"++RhAJURMQAPAAAAAAAAAA==","_self":"dbs/++RhAA==/colls/++RhAJURMQA=/docs/++RhAJURMQAPAAAAAAAAAA==/","_ts":1523885949,"id":"performance-Matt","profilePrivate":false,"rank":null,"rankProgress":0,"username":"Matt"}
