    "Explanation": "Acute urinary retention is a serious presentation to hospital and must be handled quickly to ensure no further complications. At first it may be difficult to ascertain exactly what is occuring when Mr Wright presents. But from the history and the examination it should be relatively straightforward to diagnose acute urinary retention. The fact that is is painful indicates that this is acute retention and not chronic. Also the tense lower abdomen indicates an expanded bladder.\n\nOnce you have this diagnosis it is important that the patient is quickly catheterised to relieve the pressure within the bladder. It is important to document how much fluid is drained from the catheter within your notes.\n\nEven though the pain will likely dissipate it is unlikely for the patient to be without pain at this stage so paracetamol should be prescribed regularly. It is important at this point that the surgeons come and assess the patient incase any other interventions are required. Usually a trial without catheter will be tried in 3 days time. Therefore, providing there are no contraindications, an alpha blocker should be started soon after catheterisation.",
